Times the lifespan of monsters and lords and shows it in the chat.
The message will also be shown on the Ingame HUD for a few seconds.

Monsters: time from spawn to death
Lords: time from the start of the fight to their death (intro sequence excluded)

(When fighting the gatekeeper, the time is measured from spawn to death)

[h1] Regarding the Gatekeeper fight [/h1]
(if you are not into modding you can skip this paragraph)
Unlike the behaviour trees of the other lords, in the tree of the gatekeeper (exalted champion norsca) there is no node that defines the behaviour during the intro sequence (running to the arena and jumping down).
Thus I was not able to find the exact point in the code when the real fight begins and hhus the timing is off.
If anyone has an idea how to fix this please let me know. For now we only measure the time from spawn to death (intro sequence included).
