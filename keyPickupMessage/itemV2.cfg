description = "Multiple levels contain hidden keys that unlock grimoire chests or start a level event.
A short message will be shown in the chat when someone in your game picks up one of these keys so you know when you can stop searching.

The message only shows up for the player that has the mod installed.

This also works when lighting candles and pushing bricks in certain levels. Check the options for customizations.
