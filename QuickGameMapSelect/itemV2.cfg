title = "Quick Play - select maps in random order";
description = "When you play quick play, the probability of a map being selected depends on how often your group has beat this map.
This map changes the algorithm to select all the maps in a random order.

It is like a bag with all maps in it. When you start a game, the map is removed from the bag. If there are no more maps in the bag the procedure starts from the beginning (where for the first map pick the last played map is excluded to avoid getting the same map twice in a row)
